# Kafka Topic Configuration - Development Environment
# Lower partition counts for local testing and reduced overhead.

# Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Implementation
# =======================================
# DLQ is NOT implemented as separate Kafka topics.
# Instead, failed events are routed to Delta Lake tables in the bronze schema:
#   - dlq_trips, dlq_gps_pings, dlq_driver_status, dlq_surge_updates
#   - dlq_ratings, dlq_payments, dlq_driver_profiles, dlq_rider_profiles
#
# DLQ handling is implemented in:
#   - services/spark-streaming/utils/dlq_handler.py (DLQHandler class)
#   - schemas/lakehouse/schemas/dlq_schema.py (schema definition)
#   - services/airflow/dags/dlq_monitoring_dag.py (monitoring every 15 min)
#
# Error types captured: JSON_PARSE_ERROR, SCHEMA_VIOLATION
# Storage path: s3a://rideshare-bronze/dlq/{topic_name}
