# Production patch: Remove MinIO dependencies from Loki
# - Removes wait-for-minio initContainer (no MinIO in production)
# - Deletes AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY env vars so Pod Identity provides credentials
# - Deletes S3_ENDPOINT and LOKI_S3_BUCKET env vars (bucket name is in the ConfigMap)
# - Sets AWS_DEFAULT_REGION and AWS_REGION for S3 access via Pod Identity
