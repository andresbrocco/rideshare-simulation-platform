# ServiceAccounts for workloads in the rideshare-prod namespace.
# AWS credentials are injected via EKS Pod Identity (configured in
# infrastructure/terraform/platform/main.tf). No eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn
# annotation is needed — adding one would trigger IRSA instead, which the
# trust policies no longer allow.
