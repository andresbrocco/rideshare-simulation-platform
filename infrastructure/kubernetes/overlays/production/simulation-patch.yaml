# Production patch: Configure Simulation for AWS cloud environment
# - Sets CORS_ORIGINS to production domain (replaces localhost origins)
# - Sets DEPLOYMENT_ENV to production
# - Configures S3 checkpoint storage with full save/restore via IRSA
# - Sets AWS_REGION for IRSA-based S3 access
#
# Note: ConfigMap-based settings are patched separately in configmap-core-patch.yaml.
# These env vars override ConfigMap values because they are set directly on the container.
